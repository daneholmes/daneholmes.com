				<h1>The Concealed Meaning of <em>Be-Reshit</em></h1>

				<p>When Moses de Leon revealed—or possibly wrote—the <em>Zohar</em> in the late 12th century he made the argument that within the Torah there are hidden meanings that compose a <em>real</em> Torah—one, which only the wisest of God’s servants could discern and understand. Understanding the meaning of <em>Be-reshit</em>—or “In the beginning”—and the truth hidden within, is built upon multiple leaps of logic. To find the meaning concealed in <em>be-reshit</em> one has to understand the relationship between the first three words of the Hebrew Bible: “Be-reshit bara Elohim” (Genesis 1:1). Reconstructing “Be-reshit bara Elohim” leads to the <em>Sefirot</em> and <em>Ein Sof</em>, the thing concealed within <em>be-reshit</em>. By following this logical progression, ultimately, <em>Ein Sof</em> can be found within the word <em>be-reshit</em>, and from <em>Ein Sof</em> a physical and metaphysical understanding of the world is created.</p>
				<p>The first component to unlocking the real meaning behind <em>be-reshit</em> is to change one's understanding of the meaning of the first few words of the Hebrew Bible: "Be-reshit bara Elohim." Normally this is translated as "In the beginning God created" (Genesis 1:1). The <em>Zohar</em> argues that by “dividing the Hebrew word <em>Be-reshit</em> differently and supplying slightly different vowels” reveals “the word <em>bara</em>, ‘created’…within <em>Be-reshit</em>, ‘In the beginning’” (Biale 437). Understanding Bara as a word within <em>Be-reshit</em> changes the grammatical structure of the sentence. The object of the verb—<em>Elohim</em>, “God”—now becomes the subject of the verb. This changes the reading from the conventional “In the beginning God created,” to “In the beginning created God” (Zohar 1:3b). This connotes that there was something, sometime before which created God. Understanding that there is something which “created God” leads to the <em>Sefirot</em> and <em>Ein Sof</em>, the <em>something</em> concealed within <em>be-reshit</em>.</p>
				<p>The second step to understanding what is hidden within <em>be-reshit</em> is to understand the <em>Sefirot</em> and how they relate word-to-word to “Be-reshit bara Elohim,” God, and eventually <em>Ein Sof</em>. The ten <em>sefirot</em>, or the emanations of <em>Ein Sof</em>, create the physical realm and a higher metaphysical realm, which the <em>Zohar</em> tries to tie together. The first way it does this is by linking <em>be-reshit</em> to the second <em>sefirah</em>, <em>Hokhmah</em>, or “wisdom.” This is seen when “Rabbi Yudai said, ‘what is <em>Be-reshit</em>’” it “is the Wisdom on which the world stands” (Zohar 1:3b). Wisdom, again, being <em>Hokhmah</em>, the <em>sefirah</em> of Wisdom, “from which issue[s] six springs and streams, flowing into an immense ocean. This is <em>bara shit</em>” (Zohar 1:3b). The six springs are understood as the six lower <em>sefirot</em>, revealed in the mystical Torah: <em>din</em>, power; <em>hesed</em>, love; <em>rahamim</em>, beauty; <em>hod</em>, splendor; <em>netsah</em>, eternity; and <em>yesod</em>, foundation. The upper <em>sefirot</em> are locked by a “single key, which locks everything in a single place” “punctuated by a thrust point” (Zohar 1:3b). The “key” is <em>hokmah</em>, or wisdom. And the “thrust point” is <em>binah</em>, understanding. How <em>hokmah</em> and <em>binah</em> relate to “Be-reshit bara Elohim” (Genesis 1:1) is the last step to understanding how <em>Ein Sof</em> is concealed within <em>bara</em>.</p>
				<p>Understanding the two <em>sefirot</em>: <em>hokmah</em> and <em>binah</em> and how they relate to God is the last step in finding <em>Ein Sof</em> concealed within <em>bara</em>. According to the <em>Zohar</em>, <em>Elohim</em> is associated with the <em>sefirah</em>: <em>binah</em>, or understanding. And the word <em>reshit</em> is associated with <em>hokhmah</em>, or wisdom. Changing <em>Elohim</em> and <em>reshit</em> in the original, “Be-reshit bara Elohim” changes the meaning to “In wisdom created understanding.” But, now there is no subject of the verb. To Kabalists, this is where Ein Sof is hidden, fulling the role of the missing subject of the verb, hidden within creation, or <em>bara</em>. Finally, changing the meaning all the way from the “In the beginning God created” of Genesis 1:1 to “In wisdom <em>Ein Sof</em> created understanding.”</p>
				<p>Through leaps of logic, one arrives at that which is locked behind the <em>sefirot</em>: <em>hokmah</em> and <em>binah</em>. This is <em>bara</em>, hidden within <em>be-reshit</em>, “<em>Be-reshit</em>—a revealed word combined with a concluded word. <em>Bara</em>, Created, is always concealed, closing, not opening” (Zohar 1:3b). Ultimately, for Kabalists what is hidden within <em>Be-reshit</em> is <em>bara</em> and the existence of <em>Ein Sof</em>, which through the <em>sefirot</em> inform an understanding of the physical and metaphysical universe and creation.</p>
