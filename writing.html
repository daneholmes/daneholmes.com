								<p class="title">Satan’s Soliloquy in Paradise Lost</p>
								<div class="preview-content">
									<div class="paragraph">In the opening of Book IV of <em>Paradise Lost</em>, Satan sits back and paints a complex, yet totally honest self-portrait. He starts first by establishing his motivations for sinning, creating a logical self-defense, and convincing himself that what he thinks is true. Through this process of reconciliation, Satan reveals just how self-aware he is regarding how he lost paradise. Lastly, through Satan’s final absolute refusal to return to heaven Satan positions himself as a tragic, fallen, anti-hero.<br>Satan’s soliloquy starts immediately with a tone of regret as he remembers his happy past as every part of the world now only serves to torture him. This is seen when he explains his hatred of the sun, declaring, “O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams / That bring to my remembrance from what state / I fell” (4.37-39). He hates the sun because it reminds him of the warmth of God’s love and what he once had. Looking back to his time in heaven beside God, he seems regretful recalling how God, “Upbraided none; nor was his service hard,” admitting that all he had to do was “afford [God] praise” (4.45-46). But, at this moment of his deepest self-pity, declaring “Me miserable! Which way shall I fly” (4.73) Satan sours, remembering his current pain. Unable to fly from his miserable torture —because it is admittedly self-inflicted— Satan’s sadness turns into a vain attempt at angry bargaining, “O had his powerful destiny ordained / Me some inferior angel, I had stood / Then happy” (4.58-60). In one mind he believes God made him too perfect to be happy in servitude in heaven. Had Satan been “ordained … inferior,” he <em>may</em> not have been tempted to go against God. However, in his other mind, he attempts to justify his betrayal, hypothesizing “Some other power / As great might have aspired” and gone against God as he did (4.61-62). Through this Satan reveals he blames only God for his fall. This conclusion shifts the blame solely on God, and in effect paints Satan as confused. In this final moment of Satan’s sadness—wondering if another would go against God—his jealousy and self-awareness are exposed.</div>

								<p class="title">Wealth of Destitution</p>
								<div class="preview-content">
									<div class="paragraph">A train rolled through the prairie, through the grass, and through the moonlight. The land hushed with the wind and droned with cicadas.<br>This country’s evening chorus only came to silence, gradually, in waves, as the train pressed through. And only after the light from the window in the last car twinkled out of mind did the chorus renew with an unmarked joy. Meanwhile, shadows of what-would-be sat on the distant hills, looking on without anticipation or longing. The light from the last car never twinkled out of their minds and hearts. And inside the last car, two animals played with chance, under a shaded lamp.<br>Here, had even the most discerning of observers sat in the last car of this train, they would have scarcely noticed any details. Yet, eventually, observant eyes would adjust to the darkness, whose canvas was cut only by a thin light given off by the lamp. Once fully adjusted to the blackness, our observer would doubtless be surprised to see that occupying the last car was an enormous black cat sitting upon a stool. Sitting and even anxiously rubbing his paws together. Indeed, the cat must have been there the whole time. And the lamp, which hung above him, lighted his eyes amber.<br>Secondly, the observer would notice the two purple playing cards lying face down in front of the cat. To which his eager eyes darted towards frequently. His amber iris’s—with a very anguished look—attempting to stare through the decoration of intertwined wheat embossed on the back, to see the important symbols on the other side.<br>Lastly, and only if the observer followed the darting eyes of the cat, would they notice a wolf sitting motionless across the table. His shape seemed punched out of the darkness, more shadowy than the cat’s black fur, and more real than the passing wind. And though he was not lighted by the lamp, his eyes shone more keenly from the dark than the cats ever could.

								<p class="title">Wilde and Stevenson Reflect on the Implications of London's Growth</p>
								<div class="preview-content">
									<div class="paragraph">During the nineteenth century, English cities experienced immense growth and change due to national industrialization. The population of cities increased as impoverished workers and their families continually moved from the rural countryside to the city to find work. This spike in density resulted in a rapid shifting of these cities’ atmospheres. Ultimately, the increase in density led to greater health risks, a shift in social stability, and perhaps most significantly, a change in community and connections. These new, modern British cities fostered an environment where individuals could hide, remain anonymous, and act invisibly—an action that the small country towns of Britain had previously prevented—leading to the association of cities as places lacking morals. The play <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, by Oscar Wilde, and the novella <em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, by Robert Louis Stevenson, both capture the rise and changes of the nineteenth-century English city. Despite these works’ very different tones, their outlooks upon the English city and how the urban landscapes foster anonymity through impersonality, and freedom from the connection are very similar. While the moral repercussions of anonymity they explore are different, the two works have striking similarities, including split identities, identity switching, and social duplicity. The two stories argue that the growth of cities and the new opportunities they provide are detrimental, resulting in individuality that is easily lost or corrupted.<br><em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> starts its exploration of moral misadventure and ambiguity in London, despite taking place, for the most part, in Hertfordshire. It is in London where Jack loses one identity and is given another. As a child, Jack was left, unbeknownst to him, by Miss Prim, “in the cloak-room at Victoria Station,” inside “a somewhat large, black leather hand-bag” (Wilde 2233). This excursion to the city as a child has an enormous impact upon Jack. It is in the city where a helpless child, without ever knowing it, loses his identity as Earnest. This loss, or swap, of identity is the catalyst for many of the play’s comedic elements, but also serves as a grave and subtle warning about what the city can do.</div>

								<p class="title">A False Impression</p>
								<div class="preview-content">
									<div class="paragraph">The first thing to greet visitors at the Chicago Art Institute is the Impressionism gallery and the painting Paris Street; Rainy Day. In the world-renowned museum, filled with everything from Titans, Da Vincis, and Michelangelos to O’Keeffes and Warhols, why is the first thing people are funneled to are the Impressionists? Space, possibly? I think the reason is because the Impressionist artistic movement is one of the most revered and transformative artistic movements in history. Impressionism generally “depict[s] the natural appearances of objects by means of dabs or strokes of primary unmixed colors in order to simulate actual reflected light” ("Impressionism." 1). However, unsurprisingly, it gets much deeper than that. Impressionism may have officially started in 1874, but the twenty years of change prior to 1874 is where its soul came from (Samu 1). The young artists who would become the Impressionists started their twenty-year journey in the 1850s as a reaction to dramatic changes in the world around them. This journey and the experiences had by the innovative young future Impressionists had a major impact upon their art and the subjects they addressed through their art. But is what the Impressions addressed in their art realistic?<br>The first major change in the status quo of the art world that led to the rise of Impressionism was the invention of photography during the 1850s. The 1850s have since been dubbed the “golden age” of photography in Europe; intrepid photographers exploded onto the art scene and altered the definition of art forevermore. Not only did photo studios spring up rapidly, but photography quickly became respected as an art form (Daniel 1-3). This started to especially hurt professional artists who had long made their money painting portraits (Freeland 97). Portrait artists, full-time and part-time alike, had to find a new way to survive because the basic economics of art were starting to change. Not only was the photograph hurting artists’ bottom lines, but according to Carole McNamara, it was, in a way, devaluing the traditional artistic styles: “artists saw how a photograph was an immediate way to capture motion” (qtd. in “Reexamining Link” 2). Photographs were a culmination of everything that art had been striving to achieve for centuries. Photos were able to capture scenes in perfect detail—the light, depth, and shadow all were correct to the scene. It must have been scary for artists who solely painted for a living to think that their traditional methods, such as oil and watercolor, would be replaced by photographs.</div>
